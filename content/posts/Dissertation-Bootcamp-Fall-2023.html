     The Caltech Library and the Graduate Studies Office invite graduate students who are writing their dissertations this fall to join us for a two-day writing bootcamp on September 28-29, 2023 in the Sherman Fairchild Library on the third floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bootcamp provides a calm, distraction-free environment for writing, along with refreshments and writing and formatting support. Over the two days, optional consultations with the Hixon Writing Center and Caltech librarians will help students address formatting, copyright, data, and writing questions. Signup sheets will be available starting at breakfast of Day 1.

    <p>
     Students are expected to attend both days, so please check with your advisor and lab-mates in advance of signing up to make sure they can do without you for that length of time! Just to note, the Library will check with your advisor to confirm your availability—past experience from our March Bootcamp was that advisors were happy for attendees to participate. We are planning to offer this on a more frequent basis, so your feedback will be sought both during and after the event!
