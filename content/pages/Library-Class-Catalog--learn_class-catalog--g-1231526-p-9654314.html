                  This workshop will cover how to choose the right chart type for your data and how good design choices will make your chart easier to understand. The focus will be on visualization best practices, independent of any specific visualization software, and making interactive data visualizations in Python. Learners will wrangle data into the proper format using pandas, create visualizations using Plotly, and display these visualizations and create widgets using Streamlit.
